    <h1>Thermopylae 480 BCE</h1>
    <h2>Sparta’s Finest Hour</h2>
    <p><strong>What happened?</strong> Three hundred Spartans, helped by a few thousand friends, blocked the huge Persian army at a mountain pass only fifteen metres wide. Their brave stand shocked the world and still inspires people today.</p>
    <small>Main ancient sources: Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus</small>

<!-- 2 ▸ SPARTA: THE WARRIOR STATE -->
<section id="screen2">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen2.png" alt="Infographic of Spartan society and iron money">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>Sparta: The Warrior State</h2>
    <p>Sparta had two kings, a council of older men, and strict rules for every class. Even their money was heavy iron so no one could hide piles of gold. Everything pushed citizens to focus on one job: being strong soldiers.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 3 ▸ THE AGOGE -->
<section id="screen3">

  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>The <em>Agōgē</em>: Training from Age 7</h2>
    <p>Spartan boys left home at seven to live in barracks. They wrestled, marched barefoot, and stole food to learn toughness. By twenty they joined a shared mess hall, took their shield, and were ready to fight for Sparta.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 4 ▸ PERSIAN EMPIRE -->
<section id="screen4">
  <div class="panel-img">

  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>The Persian Empire in 480 BCE</h2>
    <p>King Xerxes ruled a giant empire spread over three continents. Wide roads linked his many provinces, and his invasion force may have been 100 000–200 000 soldiers—still one of the biggest armies the Greeks had ever seen.</p>
  </div>

<!-- 5 ▸ HELLENIC LEAGUE -->
<section id="screen5">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen5.png" alt="Column of allied hoplites with name tags">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>Greek City-States Join Forces</h2>
    <p>Greece was a patchwork of small city-states. For once they teamed up: Sparta led the army on land, Athens ran the ships at sea. Other towns like Thespiae and Corinth sent fighters too.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 6 ▸ HOT GATES -->
<section id="screen6">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen6.png" alt="Cutaway map of the narrow pass and goat path">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>The Hot Gates</h2>
    <p>Thermopylae means “hot gates” because of its sulphur springs. In 480 BCE the road between mountain and sea shrank to about fifteen metres—just wide enough for the Spartans to stand shield to shield.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 7 ▸ ARMS & ARMOR -->
<section id="screen7">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen7.png" alt="Exploded view of Spartan shield, spear and helmet">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>Spartan Gear</h2>
    <p>The big round shield (<em>aspis</em>) weighed around 7 kg. The 2.4-metre spear (<em>dory</em>) poked over the shield wall. A bronze helmet, breastplate, and bold red cloak finished the look. The Greek letter λ on the shield showed “I am Spartan.”</p>
  </div>

<!-- 8 ▸ DAY 1–2 -->
<section id="screen8">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen8.png" alt="Persian assault squeezed at choke point">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>Days 1 & 2: Wall of Bronze</h2>
    <p>Persian troops charged again and again, but the pass was too narrow. Each time the Spartan shield wall pushed them back. Even the famous “Immortals” could not break through.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 9 ▸ BETRAYAL -->
<section id="screen9">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen9.png" alt="Night march up goat path led by traitor">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>The Traitor’s Path</h2>
    <p>A local man named Ephialtēs showed Xerxes a hidden goat path around the cliffs. When Leonidas heard, he sent most allies away. He and his three hundred stayed, ready to fight to the end.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 10 ▸ LAST STAND -->
<section id="screen10">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen10.png" alt="Leonidas and remaining hoplites under arrow storm">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>The Last Stand</h2>
    <p>Leonidas fell early in the final battle. His men fought over his body and then formed a tight circle. At last, a dark storm of Persian arrows ended their stand.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 11 ▸ AFTERMATH -->
<section id="screen11">
  <div class="panel-img">
    <img src="screen11.png" alt="Timeline Thermopylae to Salamis to Plataea">
  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>What Came Next</h2>
    <p>The delay at Thermopylae bought the Greeks time. A few months later their ships won the huge sea fight at Salamis. The next year they beat Persia on land at Plataea and the invasion was over.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- 12 ▸ LEGACY -->
<section id="screen12">
  <div class="panel-img">

  </div>
  <div class="panel-text">
    <h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
    <p>Artists, writers, and movie-makers love the story of Thermopylae. The phrase <em>Molōn Labe</em>—“Come and take them”—is still a shout of defiance. The exact numbers may be foggy, but the spirit of courage lives on.</p>
